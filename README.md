ðŸ”’ Task Completed: Image Encryption/Decryption Script in Python! ðŸ”’

Iâ€™m excited to announce that Iâ€™ve successfully developed a Python program for encrypting and decrypting image files using XOR operations. This script enables users to secure or reveal image content by simply providing a key.

Key Features:
Encryption: Modify your image by applying an XOR operation with a specified key.
Decryption: Restore the image to its original state using the same key.
This project was a great opportunity to explore file handling and image processing in Python, enhancing both my technical and problem-solving skills.

Looking forward to tackling more challenges and learning opportunities! ðŸš€
